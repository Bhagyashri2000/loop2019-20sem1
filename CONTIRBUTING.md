# Contributing Guidelines
Follow the steps mentioned in [README.md](README.md)

##  Guidelines
- #### Author and Problem name
Mention the name of the author, you and the name of the problem statement your solution pertains to.    

```java
/*
Problem: Counting Valleys
Author: Name
*/
```

- Avoid making changes to README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and gitguide, if you believe a change is required in any of these files create an issue and we will look into it.

- Don't delete any files already present in the repo.  
Needless to say avoid adding unnecessary files to the repo.

## Naming Conventions
- #### Problem Statement Folder:
If a file for the corresponding problem statement doesn't exist create one with the summarized problem statement as its name.    
For example : CountingValleys

- #### File :
Your solution file should be named after yourself.  
Note: Unique names are preferable.  
For example: Neha_valleys.java
